# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the HTML5 and CSS challenges for the Front End Development Certification

**Thoughts**: Thus far I'm not feeling too tested with these challenges. I'm sure that will change as I progress.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining HTML5 and CSS challenges and got through about 1/3 of Repsonsive Design With Bootstrap section.

**Thoughts**: Today I felt a slight tug not to do the challenges because I'm a little tired and Winter break with the wife and kids is starting to come to a close. In addition to that I ended up checking my work e-mail before starting so I began my hour somewhat distracted; not a good idea. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to give myself a few minutes to sort of reset my focus before starting.

### Day 3: January 3, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining Responsive Design with Bootstrap challenges and got through about half of jQuery section.

**Thoughts**: Once again felt a slight resistance to starting the challenges, but I pushed through it. I didn't make the same mistake as yesterday by reading work e-mail. Nevertheless I was still somewhat distracted. The jQuery section is proving to be slightly more difficult than previous challenges mostly because I'm not that familiar with JavaScript syntax. On the upside, I do feel like I'm actually learning with these challenges so that's exciting.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining jQuery challenges and began work on the Build a Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts**: Didn't feel as much resistence today as I did in the previous couple of days. I've switched from Tron Legacy to Inception for music to code by; I think I like Tron a little better. :) The jQuery exercises were pretty straight forward, but I'm a little fuzzy on targeting child elements. I don't quite understand how the .target class with nth-child(n) magically finds the right element. That's just something I'll have to research a little more.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed the Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts**: Had a couple of interruption during my coding session so I spent a few addition minutes working on the tribute page project. Coming up with an idea for this project was a little difficult because I'm not that creative. I finaly came to the conclusion (right or wrong, but hopefully right) that the content of the tribute page is not what matters, it's demonstrating the ability to use what has been learned up to this point. Now I did have to google a couple of bootstrappy things, like block quotes, gradient backgrounds and rounded corners for my main "header" image. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have this baby wrapped up and be on to the next thing.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Tribute Page and started the Personal Portfolio Webpage project.

**Thoughts**: Ok, so now I'm starting to feel the burn. The creative aspect of these projects is still getting in the way. Surely this will ease up as I progress and I'll over-think things a little less. Tomorrow I'm going to get out a piece of paper and sketch the portfolio page based on the user stories. I think it'll help quite a bit if I can get an idea on paper so I can actually see it. That should give me a little better aim.

### Day 7: January 7, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. Almost completed the first iteration of the navbar.

**Thoughts**: I sketched out on paper what I think the portfolio page should look like. That has helped quite a bit as I don't think putting ideas from brain to keyboard works well for me. On a slightly different note, it looks like I'll have quite a few placeholders for work since I don't have much to showcase. I should put the tribute page on there. Ended up spending most of the coding session struggling with the navbar. The bootstrap docs are ok, but I need it explained to me like I'm a 5 year old. :) I feel like I cheated a bit by "borrowing" some navbar code from the bootstrap site. Now that I have the portfolio site laid out, I'll dig to the navbar just to make sure I understand it.

### Day 8: January 8, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. The navvbar is functional including the abilitly collapse on smaller screen sizes. I've added filler text for all sections of the site and started work on smooth scrolling. Tomorrow I plan to finish the smooth scrolling stuff and start building out the first section of the site.

**Thoughts**: I have a little better handle on how the navbar works in bootstrap thanks to a couple of YouTube videos. I'm not a huge fan of the way bootstrap requires the use of the navbar class; there must be a better way! :)

### Day 9: January 9, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Ended up spending about 1.25 hours in this session. Continuing to work on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. I did manage to complete the smooth scrolling and implement the javascript necessary to make the nav links appear active. This works when clicking a nav link or scrolling down to a give section of the page. With that out of the way, I should be able to start building out the first section of the site.

**Thoughts**: Arrggghhh! The navbar smooth scrolling stuff really killed my productivity today. I feel like I understand about %25 percent of what I've coded up thus far which is a little discouraging. Today is probably the first day I've actually felt beaten up by code. lol I'll try and get a good nights sleep tonight and be more refreshed tomorrow.

### Day 10: January 10, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Work on the portfolio page continues. The about section is nearly complete. I'd like to add a better profile pic and a nice background image tomorrow. Once that's done I'll be ready to start the "work" section.

**Thoughts**: Today was a pretty productive day. I did run into a little blocker when using the img-responsive class and padding on an image. This [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9409632/border-radius-and-padding-not-playing-nice#) helped me resolve the issue. Also discovered the [lead class](https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.5/docs/css/#lead-body-copy) which is working well for the text in my about section. Definitely putting the read, search part of read, search, ask to good use.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Work on the portfolio page continues. Instead of sprucing up the about section I just went ahead and started to build the work section of the site. In the work section I'm just using the bootstrap [thumbnail class](https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.6/docs/components/#thumbnails-default) along with a little extra html for a parahraph and button. I tried this neat little utiltiy from [holderjs](http://holderjs.com/) to add placeholder image for one of the project pages. I just made color blocks for the rest because the sizing behavior is a little strange. For example, a 400x400px png file displays as the same size as a 400x275 placeholder from holderjs; it's odd. Switched to azure blob storage to host all my images. 


**Thoughts**: Another focused and productive day, I'd say. I find myself spending about 1.5 - 2 hours a night on this project including github and twitter updates. Feeling like I should reign that in and stick with 1 hour and just stop no matter where I am in my coding session. I'll try that tomorrow night.

### Day 12: January 12, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Work on the portfolio page continues. Today I worked on the contact page and messed around with two sites that allow you to send e-mail without any server side code. There are issues with this approach because of CodePen. I may dive into this a bit more at some point in the future. Also added glyphicons to the "view" and "submit" buttons. Tomorrow I'll work on the footer. 


**Thoughts**: Ok, so, real talk... today felt a lot like a cheat day. A LOT. I lifted waaay too much code from the bootstrap site because I couldn't remember the syntax for a component I wanted to use. I'm going to be more dilligent about not doing that because I don't want to cheat myself out of this learning experience. Perhaps I'll go through tutorials on the stuff I'm unfamiliar with as opposed to taking the easy way out. On the upside, I kept my word about stopping at 1-hour. Today I did that and it just felt right. :) Tomorrow is another day to get it right.

### Day 13: January 13, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: The footer is starting to take shape. I found some interesting examples on the [Material Design for Bootstrap site](https://mdbootstrap.com/) and ended up incorporating it into the site. Hopefully I'll have the footer complete tomorrow and then start working on the styling and fix any bugs I encounter. 


**Thoughts**: Today felt a little better than yesterday in terms of "borrowing" code from other sites. I started looking to YouTube for some instruction as well as docs on the material design site. I'll try to continue that trend and maybe do some reading or watching videos when I'm not coding.

### Day 14: January 14, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: The overall portfolio page is complete. Tomorrow I'll wrap it up with a little bit of fit and finish work. I'd like to make it so that each section fills an entire page height.


**Thoughts**: Today felt just... meh. I wasn't motivated at all so I feel like I wasn't too productive. I'll have to think about ways to stay focused for the future. Today is also one of those days where I feel like I'm not learning anything; I feel like I'm just copy and pasting. That's something I'll continue to do better at as well.

### Day 15: January 15, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I decided to call the portfolio page complete. I hope to revisit the page later and to do some refactoring and polishing up, but for now it meets the requirements of the challenge. Now I'm back on the code camp challenges; today was basic Javascript. 


**Thoughts**: Feeling very tired today and a bit rundown. The kids are battling sickness and I think I might be the next victim. I'm gonna try to get a good nights rest tonight and hopefully I'll feel better in the morning. Onward!

### Day 16: January 16, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on the basic javscript challenges at free code camp. 


**Thoughts**: These basic js challenges are way more difficult for me than the previous ones around HTML and CSS. Still feeling a little bit icky today, but the code must go on! Tomorrow is another day to get after it.

### Day 17: January 17, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to focus on the basic javscript challenges at free code camp. I plan to carry on with the challenges tomorrow. 


**Thoughts**: The javascript challenges today were a bit more fun that yesterday. Learning a bit about functions and manipulating arrays with things like push() and shift() has been my favorite part thus far. Completely random thought... tomorrow I'm going to take a sort of scrum approach on the days progress. What I mean is, I'll state what I worked on that day and what I plan to work on the next day. I'll use the thoughts section to maybe outline any impediments or blockers to my progress. This way the log will lean out and be a litte more readable, I think.

### Day 18: January 18, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Another day with the basic javascript challenges at free code camp. The challenges covered things like logical operators, conditionals (i.e. if, if/else, switch, etc.), and objects. There are slightly more than a dozen javascript challenges ahead of me, so I aim to finish those tomorrow. 


**Thoughts**: The progress I made today has been encouraging. Up to this point I've managed to complete two projects and 200 challenges. While the challenges have been difficult at times, I haven't had the feeling of complete hopelessness yet. lol

### Day 19: January 19, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I put in quadruple the amount of time that I should have and still didn't complete the basic javascript challenges. There are approximately 8 more to go, so _hopefully_ I'll get it wrapped up tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: Extremely long day both coding and at work. I joined codewars and completed a javascript challenge. Going through free code camp helped to prepare me; even though it was difficult, I wasn't completely lost.

### Day 20: January 20, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today, once again, I put in way more time than I should have, but I just could not let go of the profile lookup challenge. Hoping that I'll get back on track with time-boxing these coding sessions. 


**Thoughts**: The entire session was spent thrashing around on the profile lookup challenge, but I finally got it. Only needed some small hints, but I was on the right track which feels pretty awesome. The challenges are difficult for me now, but I'm trying to remain tenacious and not give up.

### Day 21: January 21, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the basic javascript challenges and started on the object oriented and functional programming challenges. Tomorrow I plan finish that out and begin on the next set.


**Thoughts**: I started a bit earlier this time around and stuck to my 1-hour time-box. That may sound silly, but time boxing like that really helps me focused and I feel like I can get more done. Overall I'm still feeling pretty positive about this challenge; coding 1-hour a night almost feels natural now.

### Day 22: January 22, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the object oriented and functional programming challenges and began the basic algorithm and scripting challenges. I'll continue working on those tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good about javascript thus far. Yes, I am getting a little challenged because I feel that my logic isnt' up to snuff. That will improve over time. My struggle today is with the palindrome challenge. I need to try and find some supplimental tutorial to fill in some of these gaps.

### Day 23: January 23, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on basic algorithm and scripting challenges at free code camp. I'll continue working on through those tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: The algorithms challenges are definitely taking awhile to complete. On average I think I'm completing 1 per coding session. Even though it is taking awhile, I don't feel like I'm stuck. The challenges and projects have helped me to search using the right questions. It's like I have one foot in order and the other in chaos and it's awesome! Definitely feel like I'm actually progressing in my knowledge level and dev proficiency.

### Day 24: January 24, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the Title Case a Sentence in the basic algorithm and scripting challenges at free code camp. I'll continue working on that guy tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: I'm really struggling with this challenge. I've looked at the hints, but haven't checked the solution nor do I want to do that. The script that I have actually passes all of the test cases, but something is still missing. I'll continue to do more searching on replace(), split(), charAt(), toUpperCase(), and toLowerCase() functions. Perhaps I can find a good tutorial to go through that can help connect the dots.

### Day 25: January 25, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed Title Case a Sentence and two additional challenges in the basic algorithm and scripting challenges at free code camp. I'll continue working through this set of challenges tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: I feel really bad about this, but I punted on the Title Case a Sentence challenge. In some way I feel justified because I did have a working solution, but I couldn't for the life of me work out what they were expecting. In any case, the follow two challenges I was able to solve without getting hints or anything. Continued to use the search, read, ask method to help knock those out. I did find a cool way to [find the max value in an array](http://www.jstips.co/en/javascript/calculate-the-max-min-value-from-an-array/). I am pledging to myself right now that I will not reach for any hints or solutions going forward with these challenges. The result of that is just impacting my learning and I don't want that.

### Day 26: January 26, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Confirm the Ending and Repeat a string repeat a string challenges in the basic algorithm and scripting section at free code camp. I'll continue working through this set of challenges tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: Today I kept to my promise of not looking up hints or solutions to these challenges. I feel like there is a mental block that, if I keep chipping away at it, there will be a break through in my logic skills. I'm definitely not thinking like a developer, but I think that will come.

### Day 27: January 27, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Truncate a string in the basic algorithm and scripting section at free code camp. I'll continue working through this set of challenges tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: Feeling a little discouraged that I'm only capable of completing one challenge a night. It's causeing me to dread the coding sessions a little bit. On the updside, I didn't get any hints or solutions and that felt pretty good.

### Day 28: January 28, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed two challenges instead of just one like yesterday. I'll continue working through this set of challenges tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: Still struggling through these algorithm and scripting challenges. I made an informal goal on twitter that I'd shoot for completing two challenges and I accomplished that. I nearly completed 3, so maybe tomorrow that will be my goal -  complete two or three algorithm and scripting challenges.

### Day 29: January 29, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I didn't complete any challenges. I worked the entire session on the Mutation challenge and still haven't completed it. I'll continue working through that and the other challenges tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: Today was a terrible day. I didn't complete a single challenge because I still have not managed how to figure out the mutation challenge. Even though I am frustrated, I'm not going to give up; I'll continue to wrestle with it tomorrow until something clicks and I complete it.

### Day 30: January 31, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Once again, I didn't complete any challenges. The entire session was spent working on the Mutation challenge. I'll continue working through that and the other challenges tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: All I can say is wow. This is probably the lowest day I've had. Something is just not clicking with this mutation challenge and I'm getting super frustrated about it. I know that I need to be using indexOf(), maybe a for loop and probable also recursion, but I just can't put the pieces together. Searching and reading has lead me to [this site](http://freewebdesigntutorials.com/javaScriptTutorials/jsStringObject/indexOfMethod.htm), but I'm still tempted to start looking at hints for this thing. Must. Resist. I'll try again tomorrow.

### Day 31: February 1, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally completed the mutation challenge! I'll continue working through the other challenges tomorrow.


**Thoughts**: Today made up for the rough day I had yestereday. I managed to finish a challenge that I honestly didn't think I was ever going to complete. Looking forward to starting the next challenge tomorrow.

### Day 32: February 2, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on and almost completed the falsy bouncer challenge. I'll continue working that one tomorrow and maybe incorporate a basic javascript video from pluralsight.


**Thoughts**: Even thought I didn't complete a challenge, I still felt like I was in some sort of flow state. As a reult, something has started to click a little bit with regard to callback functions. It's more rewarding for me to understand the concepts than to just complete challenges.

### Day 33: February 3, 2018, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Skipped

### Day 33: February 4, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on and completed the falsy bouncer challenge. I didn't watch any Pluralsight videos today; thought I might just finish these algorithm challenges first.


**Thoughts**: Having a difficult time staying motivated the last couple of days. I've noticed that if I miss one day, that it's extremely difficult to get back on track. The algorithm challenges are really kicking my behind so I think that's a contributing factor to my lack of motivation.

### Day 34: February 5, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on and completed the seek and destroy challenge. I have decided to wait until after I finish the algorithm challenges before looking at pluralsight. 


**Thoughts**: Still struggling with motivation although not nearly as bad as yesterday. It's hard to start, but once I get going the time flies and I want to continue. After I finish the basic algorithm challenges I'm going to branch off to pluralsight or some other resource and try to strengthen my javascript skills. I'll probably try that out for a few days. We'll see, though.

### Day 35: February 6, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on and completed the where do I belong challenge. Tomorrow I hope to complete the final basic algorithm scripting challenge.


**Thoughts**: Motivation was somewhat less of a problem for me today. Completing the where do I belong challenge was a nice little confidence boost. I felt like I was able to reason my way through the challenge to come up with the solution. The solution was a lot simpler than I expected. I feel like my ability to reduce complexity and start with the simple solution first is improving. Prior to free code camp I would've overthought how to solve the challenges.

### Day 36: February 7, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I FINALLY completed the basic algorithm scripting challenges! I'm not sure if I'll continue with the free code camp challenges as I want to take a deeper dive into javascript.


**Thoughts**: Put in double-time today. I found a really [great site](https://www.selftaughtjs.com/algorithm-sundays-breaking-a-rot-13-caesar-cipher/) to help get me across the goaline on the Caesers Cipher challenge. Feeling pretty good about progress so far but I need to decide if I want to sort of branch off and dig deeper into understanding javascript. Maybe I'll get some feedback from Twitter.

### Day 37: February 8, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the JSON APIs and Ajax challenges at Free Code Camp. Now I'm on to the intermediate frontend dev projects. Specifically I'm starting to work on the random quote generator. I looked at the example codepen and found that it's an api from Mashaper, so I went ahead and signed up for an account.


**Thoughts**: For now I have decided to stay on track and continue pursuing the front end dev certificate. If I want to do extracurricular javascript activities, I'll pursue that outside of the 100 days of code stuff. Who knows, that decision may change tomorrow. ;)

### Day 38: February 9, 2018, Friday 
**Today's Progress**: Skipped.

### Day 38: February 10, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I took a little bit of time to work on the random quote generator project. Spent more of my time working with postman and some Visual Studio Team Services REST APIs.


**Thoughts**: Getting back into the projects and I've discovered that I've forgotten most of what I've learned about bootstrap. lol So I'm going over the bootstrap 4 documentation to sort of refresh my memory. I think this first project will be fairly easy to compplete.

### Day 39: February 11, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I tspent the entire hour work on the random quote generator. Signed up for a random quote api over at mashape.com and hooked it all up. Now I need to iron out some formatting and also setup an onload event that will fetch the first quote. 


**Thoughts**: Had a bit of fun working on the quote generator project tonight. It was nice to connect things together and watch data dynamically apear on the screen just from the press of a button.

### Day 40: February 12, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do any project work today, but I did build a task group importer in Postman. I'll return to the random quote generator tomorrow. 


**Thoughts**: I've learned quite a bit more about just how powerful postman can be for certain things. I learned how to chain requests and set and get variables. There is a feature gap in an app I administer at work and this postman utility I built filled that gap. I'd say this was a pretty successful day.

### Day 41: February 13, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I focused on the random quote generator today. The main functionality of the app is complete. A random quote is generated when the page loads and any time you click the new quote button. Also learned that it's easier/better(?) to use JSON.parse instead of JSON.stringify when displaying text without the double quotes. Tomorrow I'll work on some styling.


**Thoughts**: Today was a fun day. Fetching data from a REST endpoint and displaying that on a web page just makes me so happy for some reason.

### Day 42: February 19, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Back from a few days off and I'm back at it. Today I returned my focus on the random quote generator. I added the tweet feature and tomorrow I'll add a bit of styling.


**Thoughts**: Felt pretty good to get back at it today, but it was still a little difficult to find motivation. I'm finding out first-hand that I really don't want to take too much time away from these challenges.

### Day 43: February 21, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I added a little bit of styling to complete the random quote generator. Tomorrow I'll get started on the weather app project. 


**Thoughts**: Stuggling to stay motivated and push through the certification program. Not sure where this is coming from, but I think it is due to all of the time off I have taken over the last week or so. I need to work out a better schedule or I will end up missing more days.

### Day 44: February 22, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started on the weather app. I found some pretty neat animated SVGs that I might end up using to show the weather conditions. I also found a pretty descent weather api from the same folks that created the random quote api. I was able to reuse a bit of the plumbing from the random quote generator which helped speed things a long. Tomorrow I'll work on getting lat and lng and pass that in to my getWeather function. 


**Thoughts**: Struggled a bit less with motivation today once I actually got going. :) Seeing the random quote generator and weather come together so quickly has given me a nice little shot in the arm. I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

### Day 45: February 24, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the weather app. Now it uses my browser's built-in navigation and passes those coordinates along in the api request for the current weather. I'm now looking at how I can pull images from flickr based on location and weather conditions.


**Thoughts**: Still struggling a bit with motivation, but I will survive! :) I thought it only took 21 days to form a habit, or was that 60? Oh well, I'm still pushing forward.

### Day 46: February 25, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the weather app. Thinking about switching to a different api for the weather. I'll have to do a bit more research before deciding on that. 


**Thoughts**: Today felt pretty good as I was actually looking forward to working more on the weather app. I'm excited about actually accomplishing some of the goals I have for this project.
